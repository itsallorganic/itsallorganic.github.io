## December 2025

As we close out 2025, this month was defined by wrapping up lingering projects and finally taking a moment to breathe. It was a strange mix of frantic energy to hit Q4 deadlines followed by the sudden stillness of the holidays.

### Key Highlights

* **Project Wrap-ups:** Managed to clear the deck of the major Q4 initiatives. It feels good to head into January without that specific baggage.
* **Downtime:** Took some actual time off during the holidays. It’s rare to fully disconnect, but this year it felt necessary to recharge before 2026.
* **2026 Strategy:** Spent the last week of the month sketching out the roadmap for the new year. The focus is shifting from maintenance to expansion.

### Lessons Learned

Looking back at the month (and the year), the biggest takeaway is the importance of pacing. The sprint at the start of December was effective, but it highlighted where the workflow bottlenecks still exist.

### Looking Ahead

January 2026 is already shaping up to be busy. The goal is to take the momentum from this December closure and apply it immediately to the new provisional goals. We are moving forward with a clean slate.
