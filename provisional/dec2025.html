        <h1>December 2025: Closing the Chapter</h1>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>
                December is always a strange mix of frantic energy and sudden stillness. As 2025 comes to a close, this month was defined by wrapping up lingering projects and finally taking a moment to breathe.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Key Highlights</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Project Wrap-ups:</strong> Managed to clear the deck of the major Q4 initiatives. It feels good to head into January without that specific baggage. The focus on clearing technical debt paid off, leaving us with a much lighter load for the new year.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Downtime:</strong> Took some actual time off during the holidays. It’s rare to fully disconnect, but this year it felt necessary to recharge before 2026. Stepping away from the screens allowed for some much-needed perspective on the long-term goals.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>
                Looking back at the month (and the year), the biggest takeaway is the importance of pacing. The sprint at the start of December was effective, but it highlighted where the workflow bottlenecks still exist. We learned that sustainability is just as important as velocity.
            </p>

            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
            <p>
                January 2026 is already shaping up to be busy. The goal is to take the momentum from this December closure and apply it immediately to the new provisional goals. We are moving forward with a clean slate.
