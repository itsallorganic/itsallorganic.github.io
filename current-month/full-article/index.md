# January 2026: The New Start

Welcome to the full breakdown of the January objectives. 

Because we are using this new "glass" layout, the text sits clearly on top of your background, but the background image is softly blurred behind this box, making the text easier to read while keeping the vibe of the site.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure
(Placeholder content...)
We are currently migrating old 2025 data into the provisional folders to ensure a clean workspace for the new year.

## Phase 2: Content Strategy
(Placeholder content...)
Focusing on quality over quantity. The new file structure allows us to host images directly within this article folder.

## Conclusion
We are ready to launch.
